## My process
- I had no prior experience as I mentioned so I had to google my way through ...
- I didn't know about making costume fonts families or colors until I was finishing up, so I missed up there.
- I'm happy with my positionings, however I'm not at all happy with the way I did it, it's basically unreadable, but it  got the job done, so I think I could improve there, would appreciate any feedback! even though I think the most honest feedback would be to delete the css file and rewrite the whole thing.
- I didn't struggle with JS that much, it was the easiest part actually, and I think I did kinda nice job there, but again.. any feedback is appreciated.
### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- vanilla js

### What I learned
- I can skip this section, every thing I wrote int this project is something I learned in the past 4 days :)

### Continued development

- I'm gonna try my hardest to organise my css and html code in my future projects, I think watching profs on YouTube might help, while getting my hands dirty.
- gonna try another frontendmentor Junior project
- maybe learn more about js functionalities it looked like there is so much more to learn even though I have a competitive programming background with c++, I think this is more of a far future quality

### Useful resources

- Kevin Powell on youtube was a great help + he showed my how little I'm in the front-end word and how much I can improve
- w3schools for sure
